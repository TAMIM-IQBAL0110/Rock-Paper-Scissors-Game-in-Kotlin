# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-in-Kotlin
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows users to play against the computer by selecting "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissor", while the computer makes a random choice. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
